# Sprint 007 — RRFlow mainline consolidation

Status: active

## Goal

Make this Tauri application the only Connectome client, bind it to generated
RRD contracts, absorb the useful diagnostics behavior from RRFlow's temporary
workbench, and advance `main` only after executable desktop/web evidence.

## Authority decisions

1. `apps/connectome` is the authoritative Connectome application.
2. RRFlow's temporary `connectome-ui` Rust/static workbench is source material,
   not a second client and not a compatibility target.
3. `@rrflow/rrd-client`, generated from `rrd-contract`, owns HTTP request and
   response types. Connectome may add view models, but not duplicate wire
   schemas, route registries, capability catalogues, or protocol versions.
4. RRFlowQL is the query-language identity. RRD is the runtime/daemon identity.
   The retired pre-release vocabulary receives no alias or fallback.
5. The application remains a Tauri 2 client for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The
   browser build is a development/preview face and must still render correctly.
6. Dependency upgrades land in independently verified cohorts. “Latest” means
   the newest stable compatible release after its migration gate passes, not a
   single unreviewable manifest rewrite.

## Baseline captured 2026-08-26

- Branch `agent/connectome-rrflow-panel` is a strict descendant of `origin/main`
  and matches its published remote at `63f5d92d`.
- Biome checks 557 files with no diagnostics.
- TypeScript check passes.
- The production frontend builds from source.
- Native `cargo check --locked` and `cargo test --locked` pass after installing
  the same Linux WebKit/libsoup packages declared in Connectome CI.
- The default production web build does not render: compression overwrites the
  original WASM files with gzip bytes while the preview server supplies no
  `Content-Encoding`. A build with compression disabled renders the Overview.
- Prior CI is green but has no browser render smoke test, so it did not detect
  that failure.
- The diagnostics page and native bridge use a handwritten, retired protocol
  schema and a fixed five-route allowlist.
- The package named `@rrflow/client` currently resolves to the SurrealDB client;
  it is not RRFlow's generated RRD client.
- The parent engine checkout records submodule revision `625e8b1b`, while its
  dirty worktree points to `63f5d92d`. No parent pointer change is committed.

## Ordered implementation slices

### Slice A — executable rendering and smoke gate

Files:

- `vite.config.ts`
- `package.json`
- `.github/workflows/connectome-ci.yml`
- `tests/smoke/*`

Work:

1. Preserve original WASM artifacts; emit compressed siblings only.
2. Add a deterministic headless browser smoke test that fails on page errors,
   verifies the Connectome shell, and captures the Overview.
3. Run the smoke test against the exact production build served by CI.

### Slice B — canonical pre-release identity

Files:

- `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- `src-tauri/src/diagnostics*`
- `src/rrflow/*`, query editor/hooks/vendor modules, UI text, tests, and docs

Work:

1. Rename the query language to RRFlowQL in symbols, modules, package aliases,
   editor labels, MIME type, and `.rrflowql` file association.
2. Rename the diagnostics protocol and types to RRD.
3. Add a repository scan that prevents retired names from returning.

### Slice C — generated RRD contract authority

Files:

- RRFlow `sdks/typescript/*`
- Connectome `package.json`
- `src/rrflow/client/*`
- `src-tauri/src/diagnostics*`
- connection, diagnostics, control-plane, and error-boundary UI

Work:

1. Mount Connectome at RRFlow `apps/connectome` and consume
   `@rrflow/rrd-client` from the parent workspace.
2. Replace handwritten route/response schemas with generated endpoint types and
   ArkType validation supplied by the SDK.
3. Replace the native fixed route allowlist with generated safe-operation
   metadata plus explicit method, payload, TLS, redirect, and size policy.
4. Bind capability rendering to RRD's authoritative catalogue.

### Slice D — absorb the temporary workbench

Keep as Tauri views backed by RRD:

- connection catalogue and negotiated instance identity;
- estate desired/observed state and reconciliation progress;
- tables, model catalogue, schema, and RRFlowQL studio;
- runtime capability/surface matrix and runtime-tool catalogue;
- prompt-flight playback, temporal stream, causal traces, cluster history, and
  graph lenses with freeze, seek, reverse, speed, and evidence inspection.

Delete after parity evidence:

- RRFlow `crates/connectome-ui` package, embedded static server, handwritten
  snapshots, and direct lower-crate dependencies.

No view may open `rrd-store`, `rrd-query`, `rrd-vector`, or another physical
crate directly. Embedded/local/remote modes cross `rrd-engine` or the public
RRD service contract.

### Slice E — dependency cohorts

1. Tooling: pnpm 11.24, Biome 2.5, TypeScript 5.9 line, ArkType 2.2, and current
   patch/minor editor/build dependencies.
2. Tauri: synchronize JS and Rust API/plugin versions exactly as required by
   Tauri's update contract; verify native check/test/build after the cohort.
3. Rendering: React 19.2 and Mantine 9 together, including official codemods and
   migration changes; verify every major view.
4. Build: Vite 5 → 7 compatibility step → Vite 8/Rolldown, then plugin majors;
   verify production WASM loading after each step.
5. Visualization/data libraries: upgrade graph, XYFlow, Sigma, CodeMirror,
   state, date, and serialization dependencies in coherent peer groups.
6. Remove inherited Surreal client/WASM/editor packages when the generated RRD
   SDK and native RRFlowQL implementation cover their used behavior. Until
   then, source provenance remains explicit and aliases may not impersonate an
   RRFlow-owned package.

## Merge and publication gate

Before advancing Connectome `main`:

- clean retired-identity and dependency-authority scans;
- Biome check and TypeScript check;
- production build plus headless render/console smoke test;
- native formatting, `cargo check`, tests, and strict Clippy;
- RRFlow generated-SDK check and Connectome/RRD process integration tests;
- Windows, macOS/ARM, and Linux required jobs green on the pushed branch;
- reviewed commit range with no generated bundle or unrelated inherited churn.

After Connectome `main` is green:

1. update the parent engine submodule pointer in an isolated commit;
2. mount that exact Connectome commit under RRFlow `apps/connectome`;
3. remove the temporary workbench only after feature-parity tests pass;
4. run the full RRFlow platform matrix;
5. push each repository in dependency order and journal exact run URLs.

## Execution journal

### 2026-08-26 — Slice A local gate

- Changed Vite compression to retain source WASM artifacts and emit `.wasm.gz`
  deployment siblings.
- Added a Playwright production-build smoke test and CI evidence upload.
- `pnpm build`: passed with compression enabled.
- `file dist/assets/*.wasm`: all three artifacts reported WebAssembly MVP
  modules; corresponding `.wasm.gz` files reported gzip data.
- `pnpm test:smoke`: passed in Chromium and attached the rendered Overview.
- Targeted Biome check: passed.
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- Native and remote platform gates remain required before merge; this entry is
  evidence for Slice A only, not a product-completion claim.

### 2026-08-26 — RRFlowQL and tooling cohort

- Renamed RRFlowQL modules, symbols, file associations, MIME type, saved-query
  extensions, editor labels, and RRFlowML documentation assets with no alias or
  forwarding module.
- Replaced RRFlow-branded query parser/editor aliases with explicitly
  attributed SurrealDB dependencies; the remaining RRFlow-branded Surreal
  aliases are separately tracked transport/UI migration work.
- Added `scripts/check-retired-identities.mjs`; it passed across 751 product
  files and is part of the frontend CI gate.
- Updated pnpm to 11.24.0, Biome to 2.5.10, TypeScript to 5.9.3, Node types to
  22.20.1, and the minimum Node runtime to 22.13.
- Biome configuration migrated to 2.5.10. All 566 checked files pass with no
  diagnostics after reviewing the newly surfaced correctness findings.
- `tsc --noEmit`, compressed production build, and Chromium render smoke pass.
- Linux native formatting, check, test, and strict Clippy pass with the locked
  dependency graph.
- Consolidated duplicate CI into one workflow and added Linux, macOS 15 ARM64,
  and Windows 2025 native jobs. Remote evidence is still pending.
- A parent `/devlabs/pnpm-workspace.yaml` caused local installs to validate the
  wrong lockfile. Connectome package installation was repeated with
  `--ignore-workspace`; the isolated lockfile and `node_modules` now match.
- Local validation commands use `pnpm --ignore-workspace ...`; this selects the
  app's declared pnpm 11.24.0 instead of the parent prototype's pnpm 11.22.0.
- Canonical RRD diagnostics and the generated TypeScript SDK are present only
  in RRFlow's unpublished worktree. The handwritten prompt-flight protocol was
  not relabelled or represented as complete RRD integration.
